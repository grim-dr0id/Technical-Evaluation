# Technical-Evaluation

## To use this file system, you can run the script and then use the mkdir, cd, touch and ls functions in the Python interpreter. For example:

$ python file_system.py
Directory 'test' created

>>> ls()
file.txt

## You can create more than one directory and move through them using the 'cd' function. Example:

>>> mkdir('dir1')
Directory 'dir1' created

>>> cd('dir1')

>>> ls()

>>> touch('file1.txt')
File 'file1.txt' created

>>> ls()
file1.txt
